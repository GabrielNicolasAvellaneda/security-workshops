#####  Authorization & Audit: allow users to specify access policies and enable audit around Hadoop from a central location via a UI, integrated with LDAP

- Goals: 
  - Install Apache Ranger on HDP 2.3
  - Sync users between Apache Ranger and LDAP
  - Configure HDFS & Hive... to use Apache Ranger 
  - Define HDFS & Hive ... Access Policy For Users
  - Login as the end user and note the authorization policies being enforced

- Pre-requisites:
  - At this point you should have setup an LDAP VM and a kerborized HDP sandbox. We will take this as a starting point and setup Ranger

## Pre-requisites

####  Create Kerberos user `rangeradmin` *(if not already created)*

- **Note: In this workshop, this should be done from your IPA node**
- **In production environments, this will likely be handled by your Active Directory or KDC/IPA Admins**

  - 1) Authenticate: `kinit admin`
  - 2) Create user: `ipa user-add rangeradmin --first=Ranger --last=Admin --shell=/sbin/nologin --password`
  - 3) Add user to admins `ipa group-add-member admins --users=rangeradmin`
  
####  Confirm Kerberos user `rangeradmin`

- On HDP node: `sudo sudo -u rangeradmin kinit`
  - At 1st login, you may be prompted to reset the password

#### Create & confirm MySQL user 'root'

* Note: In this workshop, this should be done from your HDP node

- `sudo mysql -h $(hostname -f)`
- Execute following in the MySQL shell. Change the password to your preference. 

```sql
CREATE USER 'root'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* to 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'%' = PASSWORD('hortonworks');
SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('hortonworks');
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
```

- Confirm MySQL user: `mysql -u root -h $(hostname -f) -p -e "select count(user) from mysql.user;"`
  - Output should be a simple count. Check the last step if there are errors.

###### Prepare Ambari for MySQL *(or the database you want to use)*

- Add MySQL JAR to Ambari:
  - `sudo ambari-server setup --jdbc-db=mysql --jdbc-driver=/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar`
    - If the file is not present, it is available on RHEL/CentOS with: `sudo yum -y install mysql-connector-java`

###### (Optional) Setup Solr for storing audits on HDP node

- Background: Hortonworks' general guidance is to send audit logs to both HDFS and Solr:
  - HDFS is for long term archival. 
  - Solr is for short term UI and visualization. 
  - Depending upon the volume of audit logs and the resources allocated to Solr, they can be retained for anywhere from 3 months to 1 year. 
  - If Solr is the only storage, then the compliance requirement of the enterprise will determine how long to retain these for

- Download and run script to setup solr/banana and ranger_audit dashboard using HDP Search (Solr 5.2):

```
cd
wget https://github.com/abajwa-hw/security-workshops/raw/master/scripts/setup_solr_banana.sh
chmod +x setup_solr_banana.sh
sudo ./setup_solr_banana.sh <arguments>
```
  - argument options:
    - if no arguments passed, FQDN will be used as hostname to setup dashboard/view (use this if you have created local hosts entry for host where Solr will run e.g. sandbox.hortonworks.com)
    - if "publicip" is passed, the public ip address will be used as hostname to setup dashboard/view (use this on cloud environments)
    - otherwise the passed in value will be assumed to be the hostname to setup dashboard/view

  - Solr UI should be available at http://(your hostname):6083/solr/#/ranger_audits e.g. http://sandbox.hortonworks.com:6083/solr/#/ranger_audits 
  - An Empty Banana dashboard should be available at http://(your hostname):6083/banana e.g. http://sandbox.hortonworks.com:6083/banana. 
  - As the below steps are followed to setup Solr audit for a few Hadoop services, you should start to see events in the dashboard 

## Install & Configure Ranger using Ambari

- Start the Ranger install by navigating to below link in Ambari
  - Admin -> Stacks/Versions -> Ranger -> Add service
  - When prompted, click "I have met all the requirements above" and click Proceed and choose which host to install on

#### Summary of Ranger config changes

-  Below is a summary of the congfigurations needed to enable LDAP user/group sync.
- **The settings shown are for our IPA howto. Tweak to fit your own LDAP configuration.**
  - There are many more options which you may want to review, but should not need to change.

```
Admin settings (if prompted): 
  - Ranger Admin user's password for Ambari: admin
  
DB Settings:
  - Ranger DB root password: hortonworks (or whatever you set earlier in this document)
  - Other passwords: hortonworks (or whatever you want)
  
Ranger Settings:
  - External URL = http://localhost:6080
    - *(If deploying on a cluster, this should be the FQDN of the Ranger server)*
    
Advanced ranger-ugsync-site (to sync users/groups with IPA LDAP)
  - ranger.usersync.ldap.ldapbindpassword = hortonworks (or whatever you set for 'rangeradmin')
  - ranger.usersync.ldap.searchBase = cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=hortonworks,dc=com
  - ranger.usersync.source.impl.class = ldap
  - ranger.usersync.ldap.binddn = uid=rangeradmin,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=hortonworks,dc=com
  - ranger.usersync.ldap.url = ldap://your-ldap-servers-internal-name:389
  - ranger.usersync.ldap.user.nameattribute = uid
  - ranger.usersync.ldap.user.searchbase = cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=hortonworks,dc=com
  - ranger.usersync.ldap.user.searchfilter = a single space without the quotes: " "
```
  - Test connection will not work yet as Ambari will create the DB in MySQL
  
- (Optional) - additional Ranger settings if saving audit to Solr is desired
```  
Advanced ranger-admin-site 
  - ranger.audit.solr.urls = http://(your solr host fqdn):6083/solr/ranger_audits
  - ranger.audit.source.type = solr  
```

#### Details of Ranger config changes

- Configure passwords to your preference and from earlier in this document. Also set "Ranger DB root user" to same mysql user created above:

![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-1.png?raw=true)

-----------

- Set password as previously set
- Update the External URL to `http://your-servers-fqdn:6080`. *Make sure there are no trailing slashes after this value*
- The auth method determines who is allowed to login to Ranger Web UI (local unix, AD, LDAP etc):
  - To login to Ranger as admin/admin: leave this value as default (i.e UNIX). You can skip the extra configurations below that are only needed to login to Ranger using LDAP credentials
  - To login to Ranger as LDAP users: change this to LDAP. If you set this value, there are a number of extra configuration you will need to do login to Ranger using LDAP credentials
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-2.png?raw=true)

---------
- These settings provide the details for above authentication methods. No change needed unless you would like to login to Ranger using LDAP credentials (instead of admin/admin) - in which case, you will need to change the properties under 'LDAP settings':
  - ranger.ldap.url=ldap://sandbox.hortonworks.com:389
  - ranger.ldap.user.dnpattern=uid={0},cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=hortonworks,dc=com
  - ranger.ldap.group.roleattribute=cn
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-3.png?raw=true)

---------

- Solr audit and other configs:
  - Set the Solr url to http://(your solr host fqdn):6083/solr/ranger_audits
  - Set the audit source to solr  
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-4.png?raw=true)

---------

- No change needed unless you would like to login to Ranger using LDAP credentials (instead of admin/admin) - in which case, you will need to change:
  - ranger.ldap.group.searchbase to dc=horotnworks,dc=com
  - ranger.ldap.group.searchfilter
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-5.png?raw=true)
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-6.png?raw=true)

---------

- The ranger-ugsync-site accordion is the section related to syncing user/groups from LDAP:
  - Set the bind password to that of your 'kinit admin'
  - Set the searchBase (`cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=hortonworks,dc=com` if following our IPA howto)
  - Set ranger.usersync.source.impl.class to `ldap` 

![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-7.png?raw=true)

---------

- Set the bindn (`uid=admin,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=hortonworks,dc=com` if following our IPA howto)
- Set the ldapurl to `ldap://fqdn-of-your-ldap-ipa-or-AD-server:389`
- set the user.nameattribute to `uid`
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-8.png?raw=true)

---------

- set the searchbase (`cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=hortonworks,dc=com` if following our IPA howto)
- **change user.searchfilter from empty to ' '** (i.e. a single space, without the quotes)
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-9.png?raw=true)
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-10.png?raw=true)

---------

- Under 'Custom ranger-admin-site', no changes are needed unless you would like to login to Ranger using LDAP credentials (instead of admin/admin) - in which case, you will need to add:
  - ranger.ldap.base.dn=dc=hortonworks,dc=com
  - ranger.ldap.bind.dn=uid=admin,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=hortonworks,dc=com
  - ranger.ldap.bind.password=hortonworks
  - ranger.ldap.referral=follow
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-rangersetup-11.png?raw=true)

----------
- Click Next -> Deploy to finish the wizard to start the Ranger and ugsync setup

- Once successfully installed/started, confirm Agent/Ranger started: `ps -f -C java | grep "Dproc_ranger" | awk '{print $9}'`
  - output should contain at least:
  
```
    -Dproc_rangeradmin
    -Dproc_rangerusersync
```

- Open log file to confirm agent was able to import users/groups from LDAP
  - `sudo tail -f /var/log/ranger/usersync/usersync.log`
  - Look for successful messages with "INFO LdapUserGroupBuilder"

- Open WebUI and login as admin/admin. 
http://sandbox.hortonworks.com:6080
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-start.png?raw=true)

- Your LDAP users and groups should appear in the Ranger UI, under Users/Groups
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-ldap-users.png?raw=true)

- (Optional) If at some point you get Ranger errors and would like to enable DEBUG logging, edit /usr/hdp/current/ranger-admin/ews/webapp/WEB-INF/log4j.xml and change "info" to "debug" as below. Then restart Ranger admin.
```
        <category name="org.apache.ranger" additivity="false">
                <priority value="debug" />
                <appender-ref ref="xa_log_appender" />
        </category>
```
---------------------

#####  Setup HDFS plugin for Ranger

- Open HDFS configuration in Ambari and make below changes:

  - HDFS -> Configs -> Advanced ->

    - REPOSITORY_CONFIG_PASSWORD: the password you set for the above user (e.g. hortonworks)
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-ranger-hdfs-setup2.png?raw=true)        
  - Custom hdfs-site:
    - **Ambari should set this for you automatically. Placing here for completeness:**
      - dfs.namenode.inode.attributes.provider.class: `org.apache.ranger.authorization.hadoop.RangerHdfsAuthorizer`
             
  - Advanced hadoop-env:
    - "hadoop-env template"
      - Add the following after the last instance of JAVA_JDBC_LIBS
        - `export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=${HADOOP_CLASSPATH}:${JAVA_JDBC_LIBS}:`
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-ranger-hdfs-setup3.png?raw=true)         
  - (Optional) Custom ranger-hdfs-audit: (to see HDFS audit logs immediately)
```
xasecure.audit.hdfs.async.max.flush.interval.ms=30000
xasecure.audit.hdfs.config.destination.flush.interval.seconds=60
xasecure.audit.hdfs.config.destination.open.retry.interval.seconds=60
xasecure.audit.hdfs.config.destination.rollover.interval.seconds=30
xasecure.audit.hdfs.config.local.buffer.flush.interval.seconds=60
xasecure.audit.hdfs.config.local.buffer.rollover.interval.seconds=60
```  
![Image](../master/screenshots/23-ranger-hdfs-setup4.png?raw=true) 

- Restart HDFS via Ambari. You can tail the namenode log to check for any errors:
```
sudo tail -f /var/log/hadoop/hdfs/hadoop-hdfs-namenode-`hostname -f`.log
```
 
- In Ranger UI add admins group to default policy to give access to root HDFS dir

  - Ranger -> Access Manager -> HDFS -> (clustername)_hadoop
  - Click Policy ID # 1
  - Under select group; add admins
  - Save

![Image](../master/screenshots/23-adminpolicy.png?raw=true)	

- Similarly create another policy for /ranger/audit dir in HDFS where the audits will also be written

![Image](../master/screenshots/23-ranger-hdfs-policy-audit.png?raw=true)	


- Create an HDFS dir and attempt to access it before/after adding userlevel Ranger HDFS policy
```
#run as root
sudo sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -mkdir /rangerdemo
sudo sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -chmod 700 /rangerdemo
```

- Notice the HDFS agent should show up in Ranger UI under Audit > Agents. Also notice that under Audit > Access tab you can see audit trail of what user accessed HDFS at what time with what result
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hdfs-agent.png?raw=true)

- Confirm that HDFS audits are appearing in Ranger: 
http://(your hostname):6080/index.html#!/reports/audit/bigData

- Confirm that Audits are appearing in HDFS (if configured above)
```
sudo sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -ls /ranger/audit/hdfs
```
- Confirm that Audits are appearing in Solr (if configured above):
  - http://(your hostname):6083/solr/#/ranger_audits/query

##### HDFS Audit Exercises in Ranger:
```
sudo su - ali
hadoop fs -ls /rangerdemo
## should fail saying "Failed to find any Kerberos tgt"

klist
kinit
## enter hortonworks as password. You may need to enter this multiple times if it asks you to change it

hadoop fs -ls /rangerdemo
## this should fail with "Permission denied"
```
- Notice the audit report and filter on "SERVICE TYPE"="HDFS" and "USER"="ali" to see the how denied request was logged 
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hdfs-audit-userdenied.png?raw=true)

- Add policy in Ranger PolicyManager > hdfs_sandbox > Add new policy
  - Policy name: /rangerdemo
  - Resource path: /rangerdemo
  - Recursive: True
  - User: ali and give read, write, execute
  - Rights:  give read, write, execute
  - Save > OK and wait 30s
  - ![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hdfs-setup-user.png?raw=true)
  
- Now the HDFS access should succeed
```
hadoop fs -ls /rangerdemo
```
- Now look at the audit reports for the above and filter on "SERVICE TYPE"="HDFS" and "USER"="ali" to see the how allowed request was logged 
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hdfs-audit.png?raw=true)

- Attempt to access dir before/after adding group level Ranger HDFS policy
```
su hr1
hadoop fs -ls /rangerdemo
#should fail saying "Failed to find any Kerberos tgt"
klist
kinit
#enter hortonworks as password. You may need to enter this multiple times if it asks you to change it
hadoop fs -ls /rangerdemo
#this should fail with "Permission denied". View the audit page for the new activity
```

- Add hr group to existing policy in Ranger:
  - Under Policy Manager tab, click "/rangerdemo" link
  - under group add "hr" and give read, write, execute
  - ![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hdfs-rangerdemo.png?raw=true)
  - Save > OK and wait 30s. While you wait you can review the summary of policies under Access Manager -> Reports tab in Ranger
  ![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hdfs-analytics.png?raw=true)

- This HDFS access as hr1 user should pass now. 
```
hadoop fs -ls /rangerdemo
```
- View the audit page for the new activity
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hdfs-audit-groupallowed.png?raw=true)

- Even though we did not directly grant access to hr1 user, since it is part of hr group it inherited the access.

---------------------

#####  Setup Hive plugin for Ranger

- In Ambari, add admins group and restart HDFS
hadoop.proxyuser.hive.groups: users, sales, legal, admins

- restart Hive in Ambari

- Check Audit > Agent in Ranger policy manager UI to ensure Hive agent shows up now
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hive-agent.png?raw=true)

- Create a policy for admin user granting admin access to default database
  - Ranger -> Access Manager -> under Hive -> xxxxx_hive
  - select the default policy that gives rangeradmin global access
  - under "Select Group", add admins and Save
  
  
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hive-default-admin.png?raw=true)


#####  Hive Audit Exercises in Ranger


- Create hive policies in Ranger for user ali so he has read access to all columns in sample_08 but to only 2 cols in sample_07
```
policy name: sample_07-partial
db name: default
table: sample_07
col name: code description
user: ali and check “select”
Add
```
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hive-sample07-partial.png?raw=true)

```
policy name: sample_08-full
db name: default
table: sample_08

klist
kinit
beeline
!connect jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default;principal=hive/sandbox.hortonworks.com@HORTONWORKS.COM
#Hit enter twice when it prompts for password
```
- these will not work as user does not have access to all columns of sample_07
```
desc sample_07;
select * from sample_07 limit 1;  
```
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-hive-user-rejected.png?raw=true)

- these should work  
```
select code,description from sample_07 limit 1;

kinit
beeline
!connect jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default;principal=hive/sandbox.hortonworks.com@HORTONWORKS.COM
#Hit enter twice when it prompts for password
```

- these should not work: "user does not have select priviledge"
```
desc sample_08;
select * from sample_08;  
```

- these should work  
```
select code,description from sample_08 limit 5;
!q
exit
```

- Now look at the audit reports for the above and notice that audit reports for beeline queries show up in Ranger

#####  YARN audit exercises in Ranger

- Configure YARN to use only Ranger ACLs (i.e ignore YARN ACLs)
  - Ambari > YARN > Custom ranger-yarn-security > add below property and restart YARN
    - ranger.add-yarn-authorization = false

![Image](../master/screenshots/23-ranger-yarn-config.png?raw=true)

- If not created already, create home HDFS dir for ali user
```
su hdfs
kinit -kt /etc/security/keytabs/hdfs.headless.keytab hdfs@HORTONWORKS.COM
hadoop fs -mkdir /user/ali
hadoop fs -chown ali /user/ali
exit
```
- Login as LDAP user and kinit 
````
su ali
kinit
````

- Run a test Spark job
```
cd /usr/hdp/current/spark-client
bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --master yarn-client --num-executors 3 --driver-memory 512m --executor-memory 512m --executor-cores 1 lib/spark-examples*.jar 10
```
  - It should fail with below:
```
org.apache.hadoop.yarn.exceptions.YarnException: Failed to submit application_1439300318912_0003 to YARN : org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: User ali cannot submit applications to queue root.default
```

- Now run a mapreduce job 
```
hadoop jar /usr/hdp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar pi 2 10
```
- This should fail with error similar to below:
```
org.apache.hadoop.yarn.exceptions.YarnException: Failed to submit application_1439300318912_0004 to YARN : org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: User ali cannot submit applications to queue root.default
```

- Notice the Ranger Audit page shows the jobs were denied. Also notice both jobs go to the 'default' queue and the Access enforcer is "ranger-acl" (not yarn-acl)
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger23-yarn-audit-rejected.png?raw=true)

- Setup a spark queue using the capacity scheduler view at: http://(your host):8080/#/main/views/CAPACITY-SCHEDULER/1.0.0/AUTO_CS_INSTANCE. Use the below settings and click Actions > "Save and Refresh Queues":
  - capacity: 50%
  - Max capacity: 100%
![Image](../master/screenshots/spark-queue.png?raw=true)

- Update Spark config to submit to the new spark queue. Open Ambari > YARN > Configs and change the default queue to be "spark" instead of "default". Then restart Spark.
![Image](../master/screenshots/spark-yarn-queue.png?raw=true)

- Create a Ranger policy for YARN allowing user "ali" to submit to "spark" queue. Click Add and wait 30s
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger23-yarn-policy.png?raw=true)

- Re-run the spark job. This time is should run successfully
```
cd /usr/hdp/current/spark-client
bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --master yarn-client --num-executors 3 --driver-memory 512m --executor-memory 512m --executor-cores 1 lib/spark-examples*.jar 10
```

- Notice that audit reports for these queries show up in Ranger. Also notice in the audit record, the resource name now shows the newly created queue and policy ID that was in effect.
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger23-yarn-audit-allowed.png?raw=true)

- The YARN resource manager UI also shows the same details for status of the jobs and queues the went to:

######  Access Storm UI

- Open kerborized browser

  - Close all Safari Windows on your local Mac
  - FTP /etc/krb5.conf and /etc/security/keytabs/storm.service.keytab to ~/Downloads on your local mac 
  - On you local mac run below to kinit as storm:
  ```
  sudo mv ~/Downloads/krb5.conf /etc
  kinit -Vkt ~/Downloads/storm.service.keytab --kdc-hostname=ldap.hortonworks.com storm@HORTONWORKS.COM
  ```
  - Launch Safari from the same terminal when you ran kinit to bring up kerborized browser
  ```
  /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari
  ```
   - For other browsers:
     - Firefox Goto about:config and search for network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris double-click to add value "http://storm-ui-hostname:8744". storm-ui-hostname should be replaced by the hostname where UI running (e.g sandbox.hortonworks.com)
     - Google-chrome: start from command line with: google-chrome --auth-server-whitelist="storm-ui-hostname" --auth-negotiate-delegate-whitelist="storm-ui-hostname"
     - IE: Configure trusted websites to include "storm-ui-hostname" and allow negotiation for that website   
  
- Open Storm Webui and notice it complains: http://sandbox.hortonworks.com:8744

- Try sumbiting a test topology using below
```
storm jar /usr/hdp/current/storm-client/contrib/storm-starter/storm-starter-topologies-*.jar storm.starter.WordCountTopology WordCountTopology -c localhost
```
  -  Notice that you get a AuthorizationException
  ```
  Caused by: AuthorizationException(msg:getClusterInfo is not authorized)
  ```


- Review Ranger audit for Storm and notice it was denied
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-storm-audit-denied.png?raw=true)

- Update the Storm Ranger policy to give full access to Storm user
  - Topology name: *
  - User: Storm
  - Actions: select all
  - Admin: true
  - Save
  - ![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-storm-policy.png?raw=true)

- Now the Storm UI should come up
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-stormui-working.png?raw=true)

- Submit test topology. This time is should get submitted. You can review the topology in the Storm UI
```
storm jar /usr/hdp/2.2.0.0-2041/storm/contrib/storm-starter/storm-starter-topologies-0.9.3.2.2.0.0-2041.jar storm.starter.WordCountTopology WordCountTopology -c nimbus.host=sandbox.hortonworks.com
```

- Review Ranger audit and notice the requests from storm user were allowed
![Image](../master/screenshots/ranger-storm-audit-works.png?raw=true)

- Kill Storm topology
```
storm kill WordCountTopology
```

#####  Setup Solr plugin for Ranger - TBD

--------------------

##### Ranger Audit dashboard

- At this point you should have a number of events appear in the Audit dashboard, where you can visualize the Solr audits:
  - query using the search bar.
  - view time series view of events as they come in
  - view top user accounts across events
  - distribution of repos across events
  - access types across events
  - drill down into each events details using the list at the bottom of the page
![Image](../master/screenshots/Ranger-audit-dashboard.png?raw=true)

- (Optional) Customize the dashboard by adding your own widget. 
  - To do this, you can modify the dashboards [default.json](https://github.com/abajwa-hw/security-workshops/blob/master/scripts/default.json) under /opt/banana/latest/src/app/dashboards/
  - Then rebuild and reload the new webapp using the below commands
```
#clean any previous webapp compilations
/bin/rm -f /opt/banana/latest/build/banana*.war
/bin/rm -f /opt/solr/server/webapps/banana.war

#compile latest dashboard json
cd /opt/banana/latest
ant

/bin/cp -f /opt/banana/latest/build/banana*.war /opt/solr/server/webapps/banana.war
/bin/cp -f /opt/banana/latest/jetty-contexts/banana-context.xml /opt/solr/server/contexts

#restart solr
/opt/solr/ranger_audit_server/scripts/stop_solr.sh
/opt/solr/ranger_audit_server/scripts/start_solr.sh
```
